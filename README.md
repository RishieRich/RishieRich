## ⚡ Current Focus

Building enterprise-ready agentic architectures for:

 Clinical data pipelines
 RWD analytics automation
 Knowledge graph powered AI workflows
 High-accuracy LLM agents with memory + judgment loops

## 🧩 Philosophy

Build real AI that ships, scales, and solves business problems — not demos.
Systems > Models.
Reliability > Flashiness.
Impact > Hype.
